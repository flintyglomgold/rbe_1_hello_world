## Rusts By Example

Learning Rust the Hard Way: one step at a time!

#### What is this?

I'm going through every Rust By Example located here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html , and I'm typing out *similar versions* of the examples therein.

#### What isn't this?

* Well it's not me just copy-pasting the Rust By Example code
* It's also not me typing the Rust By Example code by rote
* * Update: some of it is definitely me typing the Rust By Example code by rote.
* * Still, you gotta change it around and play with it or you won't really learn anything!
* It's also also not official, or endorsed by anyone.
* Finally, it's not *really* an example I'd use to demonstrate my programming skill. I definitionally am using this to learn, not to demonstrate.

#### Why is this here?

* To keep myself honest
* To also maintain good git practices as I am rusty (HA) at that as well.
